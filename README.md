# Microsoft Power BI
*A complete reporting solution that offers data preparation, data visualization, distribution, and management through development tools and an online platform.*

- Microsoft Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights.

**Components of Power BI:**
*Power BI consists of a Microsoft Windows desktop application called Power BI Desktop, an online SaaS (Software as a Service) service called the Power BI service, and mobile Power BI apps that are available on phones and tablets.
Designed to let people create, share, and consume business insights in the way that serves them, or their role, most effectively.*

**The flow of Power BI is:**

> Connect to data with Power BI Desktop.
> Transform and model data with Power BI Desktop.
> Create visualizations and reports with Power BI Desktop.
> Publish report to Power BI service.
> Distribute and manage reports in the Power BI service.

*The building blocks of Power BI are semantic models and visualizations.*

The elements of Power BI help to show what data is being presented, and also how it appears to those users who are consuming it. Those elements are datasets, reports, and dashboards. All elements are organized into workspaces, and they're created on capacities.

**Capacities**

Capacities are a core Power BI concept representing a set of resources used to host and deliver your Power BI content, either shared or dedicated.
A shared capacity is shared with other Microsoft customers, while a dedicated capacity is fully committed to a single customer.

**Workspaces**

Workspaces are containers for dashboards, reports, datasets, and dataflows in Power BI.

There are two types of workspaces:
> My workspace
> Workspaces

**Reports**

A Power BI report is one or more pages of visualizations such as line charts, maps, and other elements.

There are two modes to view and interact with reports:

> Reading view: When a report is opened by a user, it's displayed in reading view.

> Editing view: For individuals that have edit permissions, editing view is used to modify the different elements on the report and how they're presented.

**Dashboards**

A dashboard is a single canvas that contains zero or more tiles and widgets. Each tile pinned from a report or from Q&A displays a single visualization that was created from a dataset and pinned to the dashboard. 

> To see all information needed to make decisions in one glance.

> To monitor the most important information about your business.

> To ensure all colleagues are on the same page, viewing and using the same information.

> To monitor the health of a business, product, business unit, or marketing campaign, etc.

> To create a personalized view of a larger dashboard and show all the metrics that matter to them.

**Cleaning and transforming data in Power BI Desktop**

Cleaning and transforming data is how you prepare your data and get it ready to be used. To begin transforming and cleaning data, you use the Power BI Desktop application.

Power BI Desktop has three views:

> Report view: You can create queries to build compelling visualizations that you can share with others. You can arrange them as you want them to appear.

> Data view: See the data in your report in data model format, where you can add measures, create new columns, and manage relationships.

> Model view: Get a graphical representation of the relationships that are established in your data model and manage or modify them as needed.

**Power BI Desktop includes the Power Query Editor tool, which can help you shape and transform data so that it's ready for your models and visualizations.**
